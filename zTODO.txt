IMPORTANT
 + Crashes on exit
 + Insane memory leaks

ENGINE
 + MAIN
   - add fullscreen option (main.cpp)
     - if (fullscreen) /*glutEnterGameMode ()*/; else {glutCreateWindow ("game engine"); createMenus ();}
   - create config files w/ controls
   - implement console
   - optimize text drawing
   - crashes when you try to load a second map
   - implement menu
 + WORLD
   - use readUnknownTexture instead to load all textures
 + WATER ANIMATION
   - builder takes base texture name, and automatically finds all other textures
   - AnimatedTexture class
   - tick texture
   - how about having the base texture name, and the number of textures as a property
 + WAYPOINTS
   - trim whitespace on sprite waypoint pointer name (in builder)
   - move waypoint pointer trimming to builder as well
 + TRANSPARENCY
   - fix draw order based on transluscent geometry
 + ANIMATED FACES
   - make separate list of textures / animated textures with attributes, then read that list when map loads (read from builder too)
   - make animated textures dynamic
   - fix pool to not import 6 different animated textures plz
   - being temp deleted in animated face deconstructor
   - animate based on DT
 + POOL
   - temporarily added insideOf() for proper draw order
   - implement drawBack() function for face
   - add tinting transluscent sprite using ray method if inside water
 + DRAW ORDER
   - implement ray function
 + SKYBOX
   - 1/(W-1) for pixel offset
 + GEOMETRY
   - add transparency option
 + ENVIRONMENT
   - implement colour object
   - divide by 255 for proper colour
   - temporarily deleting skybox textures in environment destructor
   - skybox SRT

BUILDER 2.0
 + optimize builder for pre-calculating waypoint indexes
 + Implement Worldcraft *.map reading
 + Fix output directory structure being non-existant
 + Make builder determine texture extension before outputting them to the file - why the hell is the engine doing this?
 + Possibly allow textures mid-animation to be selected

TEXTURE COMPILER
 + Actually implement parameter interface - most of it is currently hard coded
 + Fix up batch files to use parameter interface

FACE CLASS
 + Should only have one property - so get rid of the property list...
