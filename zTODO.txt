ENGINE
 + MAIN
   - add fullscreen option (main.cpp)
     - if (fullscreen) /*glutEnterGameMode ()*/; else {glutCreateWindow ("game engine"); createMenus ();}
   - create config files w/ controls
   - implement console
   - optimize text drawing
   - crashes when you try to load a second map
   - implement menu
 + WORLD
   - use readUnknownTexture instead to load all textures
 + TEXTURES
   - possibly make textures ONLY stored in external file instead of directly with map file?
 + POOL
   - temporarily added insideOf() for proper draw order
   - implement ray function for tinting sprite: http://erich.realtimerendering.com/ptinpoly/
 + SKYBOX
   - fix implementation (get Ian's getPosition code)
 + ENVIRONMENT
   - implement colour object
   - divide by 255 for proper colour (create colour class)

FACE CLASS
 + Should only have one property - so get rid of the property list...

BUILDER 2.0
 + Implement Worldcraft *.map reading
 + Fix output directory structure being non-existant
 + Make builder determine texture extension before outputting them to the file - why the hell is the engine doing this?
 + Possibly allow textures mid-animation to be selected

TEXTURE COMPILER
 + Actually implement parameter interface - most of it is currently hard coded
 + Fix up batch files to use parameter interface
