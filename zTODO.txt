ENGINE
 + add fullscreen option (main.cpp)
   - if (fullscreen) /*glutEnterGameMode ()*/; else {glutCreateWindow ("game engine"); createMenus ();}
 + create config files w/ controls
 + implement console
 + optimize text drawing
 + crashes when you try to load a second map
 + implement menu
 + combine sprites and objects?
 + WATER ANIMATION
   - builder takes base texture name, and automatically finds all other textures
   - AnimatedTexture class
   - tick texture
   - how about having the base texture name, and the number of textures as a property
 + WAYPOINTS
   - trim whitespace on sprite waypoint pointer name (in builder)
   - move waypoint pointer trimming to builder as well
 + TRANSPARENCY
   - revise draw order based on distance from camera
   - loop through, calculate distances, then run a qsort

int compareDistance(const void * x, const void * y) {
	return *((int *) x) - *((int *) y);
}

qsort(students, numberOfStudents, sizeof(student), compareStudentName);

BUILDER 2.0
 + optimize builder for pre-calculating waypoint indexes
 + Implement Worldcraft *.map reading
