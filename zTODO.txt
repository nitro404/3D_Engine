   - Implement Console
   - Add keybinding ability
 + POOL
   - Temporarily added insideOf() for proper draw order
   - Implement ray function for tinting sprite and draw order: http://erich.realtimerendering.com/ptinpoly/
 + SKYBOX
   - Fix implementation using proper world position
 + FACE
   - Remove normals in builder? (Or re-add them, just ignore them?)
 + SPRITE
   - Try to fix randomization based off of preivous DT
 + WAYPOINT
   - Only need point, not full transformation?
 + MISC

   - IN GENERAL:
     - name
     - texturemap
     - width
     - height
