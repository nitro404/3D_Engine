BUILDER 2.0
 .MAP > .UNI CONVERSION
   - Point class objects are not extracted
   - Transformations are not computed
   - Face points are not converted
 + Change it so that objects know how to identify their own texture index, rather than in the to world conversion
 + Re-organize texture name => index replacement code
 + Possibly allow textures mid-animation to be selected
